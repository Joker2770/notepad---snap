Introducing Notepad-- a text editor written in C++ that works seamlessly across Windows, Linux
, and Mac platforms. Our aim is to eventually surpass Notepad++
, with a particular focus on the Chinese UOS operating system. Unlike Notepad++
, our advantage lies in our cross-platform compatibility and support for various OSes.
